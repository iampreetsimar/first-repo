// WORKING WITH REMOTES(in this case Github)

1. GIT FETCH
- downloads the commits that remote has but are missing from local repo
- updates where remote branches(origin/<branch>) point in local
-- does not change anything about local state i.e., will not update the remote 
   changes in local file system(local working directory)
-- to get these remote changes in working directory, use git merge

-- does not change anything about local state i.e., will not update the remote 
   changes in local file system(local working directory)
-- to get these remote changes in working directory, use git merge





2. GIT PULL
- is a combination of two commands:
        -> git fetch + git merge
- fetches changes from remote and merges them so that changes are shown in 
  local working directory.
